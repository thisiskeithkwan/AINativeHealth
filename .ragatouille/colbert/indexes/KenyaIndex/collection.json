  "Occurs as allergic reaction to allergens facilitated by mediators in a sensitized\nindividual. Allergens may be drugs, food, sera, stings, and intravascular contrast\nmedia.\nClinical Features\nInclude pruritus, urticaria, respiratory distress (due to laryngeal oedema,\nbronchospasm), and hypotension.\nManagement\n  Avoid offending agents.\n  Address airway, blood pressure and cardiac status.\n  Administer adrenaline 0.2\u20130.5mg IM repeated every 10\u201315 minutes for 3\ndoses.\n  Administer aminophylline 6mg/kg IV over 20 minutes if there is wheezing\n  Administer antihistamine:\n\u2022 Chlorpheniramine 10mg IV slowly. IM/SC then continued 10mg 8 hourly for\n24\u201348 hours (children 0.1mg/kg)\n\u2022 100mg IV is of secondary value but useful to prevent delayed recurrences\n  Observe patients with mild to moderate reaction, e.g., urticaria or mild\nbronchospasm, for at least 6 hours because attacks may recur after full\nrecovery.\n  Give nebulized oxygen OR bronchodilators, e.g., salbutamol.\nReferral/Admission\nLevel 2 refer, level 3 admit where possible, in the case of:\n  Severe reactions, e.g., hypotension, severe bronchospasm (especially with\norally ingested antigens). Severe reactions require intravenous fluid\nreplacement with normal saline and close monitoring, especially BP and\nurinary output.",
  "This is due to asystole, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiovascular collapse in\nextreme arterial hypotension. There is absence of heart sounds and of carotid\nand femoral pulses. There may be associated apnoea and cyanosis.\n  Cessation of circulation requires immediate treatment.\nOptimal chances of survival are achieved when cardiopulmonary resuscitation\nbegins within 4 minutes of the arrest, and when advanced cardiac life support including intubation, intravenous medications, and defibrillation is started within 8\nminutes.\nMANAGEMENT\nAirway\nClear airway immediately. Vomitus and secretions should be aspirated or\nremoved with fingers or handkerchief.\nVentilation\nInflate lungs with air or oxygen by:\n  mouth-to-mouth OR\n  mouth-to-nose insufflation OR\n  bag and mask devices (ensure thoraco-abdominal motion).\nCirculation\nCardiac Massage\nCarry out external cardiac massage (compressions) by applying appropriate\npressure over the sternum. One breath should be interposed between every 4 to\n5 cardiac compressions.\nDefribrillation\nUse standard defibrillators delivering 200\u2013360 J and biphasic defibrillators\ndelivering 150\u2013200 J.\nDrugs\nAdminister intravenous adrenaline 1mg bolus, repeated every 3 to 5 minutes, OR\nvassopressin 40 IU by intravenous push, OR amiodarone 300mg in 20\u201330ml\nnormal saline.\nAdmit/Refer\n  Undertake thorough investigation and treatment of the underlying cause.\n  For level 2, observe closely and refer immediately.\n  For level 3, admit for observation then refer to a higher level immediately.\n",
  "Shock\nThis is circulatory insufficiency and becomes irreversible if not promptly\ncorrected. Shock may be either hypovolaemic shock or septic shock.\n HYPOVOLAEMIC SHOCK\nThis condition is caused by the loss of intravascular fluid volume. Decreased\nblood and/or fluid leads to decreased diastolic filling pressure and volumes.\nCauses\n  Haemorrhage\n  Severe burns: Rapid plasma loss from damaged tissues when over 25% of\nthe body surface area (BSA) is involved\n  Endotoxaemia makes matters worse\n  Dehydration\n  Vomiting and diarrhoea (cholera and enterocolitis)\n  Septicaemia\n  Intestinal obstruction (mechanical or paralytic ileus)\nClinical Features\nThe patient becomes cold, clammy, drowsy, and tachypnoeic. There is cold\nsweat and restlessness. Blood pressure may become unrecordable. The skin is\npale and cold with collapsed peripheral veins, with a tachycardia. The urinary\noutput is an indicator of renal blood flow, and will fall significantly. Temperature is\nsubnormal (less than 35o C).\nInvestigations\n  Hb and PCV\n  Urea and electrolytes\n  Blood sugar\n  Group and cross-match blood\n  Blood gas analysis if possible\n  Blood cultures\nManagement\nOnce shock is suspected, the medical staff taking care of the patient should\ninitiate appropriate and coordinated emergency management.\n  Treat the primary problem, e.g., control haemorrhage, endotoxaemia, etc.\n  Secure a large intravenous line; do a cut-down if there is no accessible\nperipheral line.\n  Use a central venous pressure line if available.\n  Start infusion of isotonic saline (normal saline), or run 2 litres fast in an adult.\n  Group and cross-match blood before you give plasma expanders (dextran 70,\netc.).\n  Transfuse in cases of blood loss, or shock due to burns.\n  If shock is due to vomiting or diarrhoea, replace continuing fluid loss.\n\u2022 Adults: 1 litre 6 hourly Hartmann\u2019s solution or even normal saline.\n\u2022 Continue with IV fluids till shock reversed and cause treated.\n  Closely monitor vital signs.\n  Monitor urinary output.\n  Administer broad spectrum bactericidal antibiotics if septic shock is\nsuspected.\n  Continue maintenance until shock is reversed and the cause is reversed. If\ncondition does not improve refer to higher levels\n\n\nSEPTIC SHOCK\nThis condition is due to systemic sepsis and may result in hypotension or\nmultiple organ failure\nClinical Features\nInitially \u201cwarm shock\u201d: increased heart rate, diaphoresis, warm skin. Later \u201ccold\nshock\u201d: decreased cardiac output; cool vasoconstricted skin.\nComplications\n  Pulmonary oedema\n  Renal failure\n  Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC)\nInvestigations and Diagnosis at Level 3\n  Hb, WBC, platelets, urea and electrolytes, creatinine\n  Blood sugar culture and sensitivity (blood and body fluids)\nManagement \u2013 General\n  Resuscitate with normal saline or dextran 70. Large volumes may be required\nbut watch for heart failure.\n  Monitor pulse and BP hourly.\n  Catheterize and monitor urine output hourly. If less than 20ml/hr after\nadequate fluid replacement, give frusemide 80mg IV STAT.\n  Administer oxygen via face mask\n  Determine and treat the cause.\nManagement \u2013 Pharmacological\n  Commence resuscitation measures immediately the patient is seen.\n  Start empirically on:\n\u2022 Benzyl penicillin 4 mega units IV every 6 hours\n\u2022 + gentamicin 80mg IV 8 hourly\n\u2022 + metronidazole 500mg IV 8 hourly OR 1g suppositories rectally 8 hourly.\n  Start oral metronidazole 400mg 8 hourly as soon as patient is able to swallow.\nUse of other antibiotics will depend on source of infection and culture and\nsensitivity results.\nRefer\nMake the decision to refer if the case is complicated, especially if urinary output\nstarts falling; serum urea, creatinine, and potassium begin to rise; or there is\nevidence of any other organ failure despite attention to adequate hydration with\nbrisk electrolyte balancing, and antimicrobial administration. The onset of\ndisseminated intravascular coagulopathy should always be anticipated.\n"
